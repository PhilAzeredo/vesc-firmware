# VESC Configurations
Most of these configuration files are for version 4.12 of the VESC hardware. Be careful, the versions are not compatible. Versions for 4.X will *NOT* work with VESC 6.X, and generally cause ungood things to happen.

The configuration for VESC-6 is currently VESC-6-Plus-30k.xml. You may tweak the parameters for your needs, the configuration is sort of a baseline.

For VESC 4.X versions (i.e. everything except for VESC-X (FOCBOX) and VESC 6 ), the MIT team recommends using the `6.141_bldc_old_hw_30k_erpm.xml` VESC config.

For the VESC-X (FOCBOX), the 6.141 team recommends the `6.141_bldc_VESC_X_hw_30k_erpm.xml` VESC config.

For convenience, more simply named duplicate configs are: FOCBOX_hw_30k_erpm.xml for the FOCBOX, and VESC_30k_erpm.xml for the VESC 4.12 and clones.
